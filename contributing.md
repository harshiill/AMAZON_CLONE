## Style Guide 🎨

Keep your code clean and consistent:
- Use meaningful names.
- Keep indentation and formatting consistent with the codebase.
- Write clear and concise comments when needed.
- Follow any existing patterns already in the code.

If you're unsure about style, check how other parts of the code are written and follow suit.
